# Tailwind CSS Gradient Compatibility

This repository demonstrates a subtle issue with Tailwind CSS gradients where the choice of `from` and `to` colors significantly impacts the visual outcome.  The issue is not strictly an error but highlights the importance of thoughtful color selection when working with gradients.

The `bug.html` file shows an example where the color combination might lead to an unexpected gradient appearance.  The `solution.html` file offers a more harmonious color choice.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
3. Observe the gradient.  You may find the transition abrupt or visually unappealing.
4. Open `solution.html` and compare the improved gradient.

## Solution
Carefully selecting colors that blend smoothly is essential for creating visually pleasing gradients with Tailwind CSS. Consider using color palettes or tools to aid in color selection for gradients.
