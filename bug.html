This code uses Tailwind's gradient feature.  However, if the `from` and `to` colors are not compatible (e.g., vastly different hues, high contrast), it may produce unexpected visual results. This is not necessarily an error, but a nuance that needs attention in the design phase, especially with more complex gradients.
